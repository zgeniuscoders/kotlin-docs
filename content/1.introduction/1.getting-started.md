# Hello world

Voici un programme simple qui affiche "Hello, world!" :

```ts [kotlin]
fun main() {
    println("Hello, world!")
}
```

In Kotlin:

- fun is used to declare a function
- the main() function is where your program starts from
- he body of a function is written within curly braces {}
- println() and print() functions print their arguments to standard output
